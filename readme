Build a greenfield app with rest api for calculating total transfer cost for a ondemand taxi app using NodeJS.

- Build a pricing module with rest api to find available pricing for different vehicles for different 
  city based on disctance travelling.
- Organization(client) has many pricing based on city and vehicle type.
- Pricing should be calculated based on a base price with fix distance and then per km price for remaining distance. 
  Ex. Base km is 10 km. And base price is 25 euro. Then each additional km cost 2 EUR for van and 1 EUR for sedan.
- Api should return pricing for both vehicles of that city for that organization.

* Use postgresql for the Database.
* use service object for calculating price. Dont write all code in controller.
* Every price will be in cent so it can be calculated without the decimal issues
* Design schema with proper validation while taking inputs from api payloads and use validation on service object appropriately.
* Coding style is important. Please follow some standard linting like airbnb or any popular one.
